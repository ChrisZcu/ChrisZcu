<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

Hello! I am a master student in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/) at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](www.sustech.edu.cn)). I am a member of DBGroup@SUSTech lab, advised by [Prof.Qiaomu Shen](https://www.shenqiaomu.com/about/) and [Prof.Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/). My research interests include big data system, spatialtemporal data and visualization. Now, I am trying to improve the efficiency of current distributed system (e.g., Hive, Spark and Hadoop) via heterogeneous computing and visualization technology.

Recently I am interning at Tencent PCG group, acting as a data engineer in the Data Platform Center. I am also looking for a job, feel free [to contact with me](zhangcz2021@mail.sustech.edu.cn) if you are intersted in me, or we share common research interst.
